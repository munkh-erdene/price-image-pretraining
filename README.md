# About
This repo's attempt is try to pre-train images of prices.

# Todo
- Write simple cropper data augmenter since price image doesn't have much color
- Create an encoder model
- Do some contrastive training
- Plot some image's features on tSNE
- Freeze trained layer for preparation of finetune
- Fine-tune model for classification
- Evaluate classification result and also plot features
